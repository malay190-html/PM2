    <h2>Problem Statement: Parking Challenges at the University of South Carolina</h2>
    <p>At the University of South Carolina, Columbia (UofSC), students, faculty, and visitors face increasing challenges in finding available parking spaces on campus. The limited number of parking spots, coupled with rising student enrollment and ongoing campus events, has led to frequent overcrowding in university parking lots. This issue often results in delays, frustration, and the need for commuters to park off-campus, creating additional inconveniences such as longer walking distances to class or work. The current parking system needs improvement to better accommodate the growing campus population and ensure smoother access for all university members.</p>
